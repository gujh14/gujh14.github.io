Bortezomib: drug used for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma CMap: a collection of genome wide expression profiles of cell lines treated with \u0026gt; 20,000 chemicals Main Results Figure 1. GALNT14 as a putative molecular target for lung cancer metastasis.\n1a. TCGA Lung adenocarcinoma cohort의 516명 lung cancer 환자의 transcriptome data. 1b. relapse-free survival / DEG 분석에서 7개의 gene들이 검출되었고, 그 7개의 gene의 expression이 높은 group, 낮은 group으로 분류. 1c. metastasis와 tumor signature가 high-expression group에서 enrich 되었음. 1d. GALNT14만 단독으로 보아도 metastasis와 tumor 에서 enrich 되어 있음을 알 수 있음. 1e, 1f. GALNT14이 각각 metastatic potential과 tumorigenic potential이 있다는 in vivo 실험 결과. 1g. Metastatic lung cancer cell이 non-metastatic cancer보다 GALNT14 depletion에 더 vulnerable. 1h. GALNT14이 survival에 분명한 negative correlation을 보임.\n이것으로 미루어보아, GALNT14이 lung cancer metastasis의 promising molecular target이라는 것을 알 수 있음. Figure 5. In vivo validation of the anti-metastatic effect of BTZ. BTZ의 anti-migration, anti-invasion effect를 in vitro level에서 확인한 뒤 in vivo에서 cancer metastasis efficacy를 확인한 실험 결과\n5a. 쥐의 꼬리 정맥으로 H460 lung cancer cell을 주입하여 local metastasis를 유도하고 control 군, BTZ 처리군, CFZ 처리군으로 구분하였음. 5b. BTZ, CFZ의 proteasome inhibition을 확인하기 위해 혈액에서 proteasome activity를 측정한 결과. 상당히 줄어들었음을 알 수 있음. P.C. 는 positive control 5c. Body weight 정보. 항암제 처리로 인해 다른 조직 등에 dramatic한 영향은 없었음. 5d. Lung cancer로 metastasis 유무 사진. Vehicle과 CFZ는 상당부분 Metastasis가 일어난 것을 볼 수 있지만 BTZ는 6개 중 1개만 미약하게 metastasis 발생. 5e. H\u0026amp;E staining 후의 lung image 5f. tumor nodule size의 average. BTZ는 매우 작음. 5g. tumor nodule의 수 분포. BTZ 매우 적음. 5h. proteasome activity 차이 Discussion Unlike other studies that used CMap, they focused exclusively on a target gene related to a pertinent phenotype and identified BTZ as a drug candidate with novel anti-metastatic effects. In pathway level, the most enriched pathway was TGF￼ signaling, and they also identified the GALNT14-TGF￼ signature, which has invasive properties that are attenuated by BTZ. They integrated multiple independent expression signatures from cancer patients(TCGA), genetic perturbations(knock-down or overexpression), and drug treatment(CMap).
